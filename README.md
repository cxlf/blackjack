# blackjack

this repo consists of 3 python files:
1. blackjack.py -> play a 1v1 blackjack game :DD
2. dealer_bust_sim.py -> this simulates whether the dealer busts given a random face up card
3. dealer_bust_simV2.py -> this simulates the chances of the dealer busting given both a random face card and a number of iterations
